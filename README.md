This repository holds the mathematical model, documentation, functional descriptions and source files of an Engineering Drawing and 3D CAD development software as a part of COP290 Course at IIT Delhi. 
Team Members: Ayush Verma (2016CS10374), Pradyumna (2106CS10375)

# Aim
The package is supposed to have the following functionalities:

1) We should be able to interactively input or read from a file either 
    i) an isometric drawing and a 3D object model or 
    ii) projections on to any cross section.
2) Given the 3D model description we should be able to generate projections on to any cross section or cutting plane.
3) Given two or more projections we should be able to interactively recover the 3D description and produce an isometric drawing from any        view direction.
